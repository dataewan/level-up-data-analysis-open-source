# Level up your data analysis

## Start to use open source tools

Most data analysis is done using tools like Excel,
Powerpoint,
Tableau,
and so on.
Lots of valuable work is done using these tools,
helping people make important decisions.

This book is for anyone doing the good work using those tools,
who wants to make their life easier.
There are tools out there that can automate the boring tasks you don't like to do,
work with larger datasets,
and do more complicated analysis.

This book is for anyone working in commerce, finance, technology, marketing, science, production;
any field where data and analysis are increasingly important.
